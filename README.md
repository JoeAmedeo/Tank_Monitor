# Tank_Monitor

This Project contains the code for my IoT like tank monitoring system. The intent of this project is to utilize a raspberry pi 3 and some peripherals to monitor the tempurature and humidity of two crested gecko tanks. The prerequisite items to complete this project include:

//TODO: update with purchasing links
1) a raspberry pi (personally used raspberry pi 3)
2) a microSD card (at least 16 GB)
3) a microUSB charger
3) 2 dht22 tempurature/humidity sensors
4) 6 wires (for connecting sensors to the pi)
5) 2 10kOhm resistors
optional) 2 raspberry pi fans

//TODO: update ReadMe with project architecture, technologies, and anything else needed.
